## Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis Tableau is used to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. Data is imported, styled, and portrayed by creating worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset.

This analysis and presentation is utilized to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

Raw data was downloaded from the openSource Citi Bikes company in New York City for the month of August as the core data for this analysis.

Once the .csv data is downloaded, using Python and Pandas dataframe techniques the "tripduration" column needed to be changed from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00).  This new dataframe was exported to a new .csv file used for the analysis.

Then, using this newly converted .csv, visualizations were created in Tableau to:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
- Create two additional analysis to further depict to the investors if this is a good business opportunity.  The additonal analysis that was performed was:
    - Show the number of riders utilizing the bikes based on the hour of the day, broken down by gender
    - The number of riders utilizing bikes compared to the year they were born

Once these visualizations were create, a Story was created to summarize and paint the picture to the investors of the analysis and key outcomes of the analysis.
